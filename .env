FLASK_APP=app # The word APP is from the folder name app that was created, if you name it something other than app you have to change it here so 
FLASK_RUN=development # There are tons of other servers you can be working on were just going to use development 
#DATABASE_URI=None # because we havent made our database were going to set it to None. YOU MUST put a placeholder or you might receive an error. Once you have created an instance in Elephantsql the code should look like this (See below)
DATABASE_URI=postgresql://yuttbgfu:znDPMITQfZ1qipRVsW05UV0DCD_B-d5h@mahmud.db.elephantsql.com/yuttbgfu #This is thu URL from Elephantsql.com after creating a new instance the details page has the URL. BE SURE TO ADD THE LETTERS 'ql' AFTER 'postgres' LIKE SO: postgres('ql')://yuttbgfu:znDPMITQfZ1qipRVsW05UV0DCD_B-d5h@mahmud.db.elephantsql.com/yuttbgfu. The reason for this is because SQLALCHEMY the program were going to be importing in order to help work the database stuff. SQLALCHEMY will be VERY upset and it work if you DONT put 'ql'
